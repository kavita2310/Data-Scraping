<h1>Worldometer Real-Time World Statistics</h1>

<h1>Project Overview:</h1>
The project aims to scrape real-time world statistics data from Worldometer using Python. 
Worldometer is a website that provides live statistics on various global metrics, such as population, 
COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries as well as other demographic and economic indicators. 

<h1>Dataset Description:</h1>
The dataset will contain the following information:<br>
•	Country: Country name.<br>
•	Other Total: Total of the other.<br>
•	Cases New: New cases.<br>
•	Cases Total: Total number of cases.<br>
•	 Deaths New: New deaths.<br>
•	Deaths Total: Total of deaths.<br>
•	Recovered New: New recovered persons.<br>
•	Recovered Active: Active recovered persons.<br>
•	Cases Serious: Serious cases.<br>
•	Critical Total Cases: Total critical cases.<br>
•	1M Pop Deaths: Per 1 million population of deaths.<br>
•	1M Pop Total: Per 1 million population of total persons.<br>
•	Tests: Number of tests.<br>
•	1M Pop Population: Per 1 million population.<br>

<h1>Project Objectives:</h1>
1)Data Extraction: Scrape real-time world statistics such as global population, COVID-19 cases, deaths, births and other metrics.<br>
2)Real-Time Data: Continuously collect updated information and possibly store it for further analysis or visualization.<br>
3)Automated Scraping: Use Python scripts to automate the process of collecting data at regular intervals.<br>
4)Data Storage: Store the scraped data in a database or file format for later use(e.g.,CSV)<br>
5)Data Analysis: Analyze the scraped data to find trends, correlation, or any interesting insights.<br>

<h1>Tools and Libraries:</h1>
1)Requests: For making HTTP requests to the Worldometer website.<br>
2)BeautifulSoup: To parse the HTML content and extract relevant data.<br>
3)Pandas: For data manipulation and storage in a tabular formate(e.g.,CSV)<br>

<h1><Expected Outcomes:</h1>
•	Scraping Data: A structured dataset containing information about Worldmeter Real-Time World Statistics Data.<br>
•	Insights: Basic analysis and insights extracted from the scraped data.<br>
•	Code: A well- structured and documented codebase for the web scraper and data analysis.<br>
